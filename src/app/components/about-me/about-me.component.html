      I'm a full-stack software engineer with 3+ years of experience building <strong>cloud-native microservices, real-time web apps, and LLM-powered platforms.</strong>  
      I love designing <strong>performant APIs, automating deployments with AWS and Kubernetes, and optimizing backend systems</strong> that handle 50K+ concurrent sessions.

      Currently at <strong>PNC</strong>, I'm building authentication microservices that securely support 50K+ concurrent sessions across enterprise banking apps, 
      creating real-time online banking dashboards, and improving systems that process 25K+ daily transactions.  
      Before that at <strong>Bounteous</strong>, I helped modernize e-commerce platforms, built CQRS-based pricing engines, and designed high-throughput REST APIs that power order management for millions of customers.  
      I'm always excited to tackle complex technical challenges and build scalable, high-performance systems that make a difference.
